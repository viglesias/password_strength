# Introduction

Check password strength against several rules. Includes ActiveRecord/ActiveModel support.

<a href="https://travis-ci.org/fnando/password_strength"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/fnando/password_strength.svg" alt="Build Status" /></a>

Validates the strength of a password according to several rules:

* size
* 3+ numbers
* 2+ special characters
* uppercased and downcased letters
* combination of numbers, letters and symbols
* password contains username
* sequences (123, abc, aaa)
* repetitions
* can't be a common password (view list at support/common.txt)

Some results:

* `123`: weak
* `123abc`: weak
* `aaaaaa`: weak
* `myPass145`: good
* `myPass145$`: strong

## Install

```
gem install password_strength
```

or put this in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "password_strength"
```

The JavaScript code is also available as a NPM package.

```
npm install @fnando/password_strength --save
```

If you want the source go to http://github.com/fnando/password_strength

## Usage

```ruby
strength = PasswordStrength.test("johndoe", "mypass")
#=> return a object

strength.good?
#=> status == :good

strength.weak?
#=> status == :weak

strength.strong?
#=> status == :strong

strength.status
#=> can be :weak, :good, :strong

strength.valid?(:strong)
#=> strength == :strong

strength.valid?(:good)
#=> strength == :good or strength == :strong
```

## ActiveRecord/ActiveModel

The PasswordStrength library comes with ActiveRecord/ActiveModel support.

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_strength_of :password
end
```

To be honest, you can use it with plain ActiveModel objects.

```ruby
class Person
  include ActiveModel::Model
  validates_strength_of :password
end

# or simply

class Person
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  validates_strength_of :password
end
```

The default options are `:level => :good, :with => :username`.

If you want to compare your password against other field, you have to set the `:with` option.

```ruby
validates_strength_of :password, :with => :email
```

The available levels are: `:weak`, `:good` and `:strong`.

```ruby
validates_strength_of :password, :with => :email, :level => :good
```

Also you can set level with a lambda.

```ruby
validates_strength_of :password, :with => :email, :level => lambda {|u| :good }
```

You can also provide a custom class/module that will test that password.

```ruby
validates_strength_of :password, :using => CustomPasswordTester
```

Your `CustomPasswordTester` class should override the default implementation. In practice, you're going to override only the `test` method that must call one of the following methods: `invalid!`, `weak!`, `good!` or `strong!`.

```ruby
class CustomPasswordTester < PasswordStrength::Base
  def test
    if password != "mypass"
      invalid!
    else
      strong!
    end
  end
end
```

The tester above will accept only +mypass+ as password.

PasswordStrength implements two validators: `PasswordStrength::Base` and `PasswordStrength::Validators::Windows2008`.

**ATTENTION:** Custom validators are not supported by JavaScript yet!

## JavaScript

The PasswordStrength also implements the algorithm in the JavaScript.

```javascript
var strength = PasswordStrength.test("johndoe", "mypass");
strength.isGood();
strength.isStrong();
strength.isWeak();
strength.isValid("good");
```

The API is basically the same!

You can use the `:exclude` option. Only regular expressions are supported for now.

```javascript
var strength = PasswordStrength.test("johndoe", "password with whitespaces", {exclude: /\s/});
strength.isInvalid();
```

Additionaly, a jQuery plugin is available.

```javascript
$.strength("#username", "#password");
```

The line above will validate the `#password` field against `#username`.
The result will be an image to the respective strength status. By default the image path will be
`/images/weak.png`, `/images/good.png` and `/images/strong.png`.

You can overwrite the image path and the default callback.

```javascript
$.strength.weakImage = "/weak.png";
$.strength.goodImage = "/good.png";
$.strength.strongImage = "/strong.png";
$.strength.callback = function(username, password, strength) {
    // do whatever you want
};
```

If you just want to overwrite the callback, you can simple do

```javascript
$.strength("#username", "#password", function(username, password, strength){
    // do whatever you want
});
```

Get the files:

* https://github.com/fnando/password_strength/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/jquery_strength.js
* https://github.com/fnando/password_strength/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/password_strength.js

If you're using asset pipeline, just add the following lines to your `application.js`.

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require password_strength
//= require jquery_strength
```

## Running tests

### Ruby

#### For current version
1. Install all dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `rake test`.

#### Execute tests with appraisal gem
For generating a version gemfile for all gem versions configured on aprraisal gem, you have to execute:
`bundle exec appraisal install`

You can execute tests with diferentes gemfiles.lock. Example:

*Gemfile with activemodel 5.2.3*
`bundle exec appraisal activemodel-5.2.3 rake test`

You can check all created gemfiles for differents versions on _gemfiles_ folder.

### JavaScript

1. Install Node.js, then run `npm install`.
2. Open `test/password_strength_test.html` in your target browser.
